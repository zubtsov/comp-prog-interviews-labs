    Duplicated number.
    The input \textbf{nums} is supposed to be an array of unique integers ranging from 1 to \textbf{nums.length} (inclusive).
    However, there is a mistake: one of the numbers in the array is duplicated, which means another number is missing.
    Find and return the \textbf{sum} of the duplicated number and the missing number.
    Example: in the array [4,3,3,1], 3 is present twice and 2 is missing, so 3+2=5 should be returned.
